# J3 Dev Personal Blog

This repository holds the ![Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) code for my Personal Developer Blog.  The articles hosted on it are mostly cross posted from ![Dev.to](https://www.dev.to).  I might in the future add the feature to create my posts from within the Blog page itself but currently just want a back up area that can be linked to from my personal site for my own blog without linking directly to Dev.
